### below ones are the codes for tomorrow practicals Computer Science - II

Experiment No. 5[Exceptions]
1.Write assembly language program to add all the BCD numbers to a block from 1000 H to 8008 H. Store Sum at memory location 100A H. [Assume SUM is 8 bit]. 			[20]
2. Enter the program on the microprocessor kit. 							[5]
3. Execute the program. Write the contents of data memory locations
before and after execution as well as the contents of the registers
used in the program after execution and also the bit contents of all
five flags individually. Verify the results. 								[5]

Experiment No. 1
1. Write a program to add two 8 bit hexadecimal numbers. The numbers are stored at memory location 1000H and 1001H. Store the result at memory location 1002H. 		[20]
2. Enter the program on the microprocessor kit. 							[5]
3. Execute the program. Write the contents of data memory locations
before and after execution as well as the contents of the registers
used in the program after execution and also the bit contents of all
five flags individually. Verify the results. 								[5]

Experiment No. 2
1. Write assembly language program to subtract two 8-bit hexadecimal numbers. The numbers are stored at memory location 1000H and 1001H. Store the result at memory location 1002H. 												[20]
2. Enter the program on the microprocessor kit. 							[5]
3. Execute the program. Write the contents of data memory locations
before and after execution as well as the contents of the registers
used in the program after execution and also the bit contents of all
five flags individually. Verify the results. 								[5]

Experiment No. 3
1. Write assembly language program to find greater of 2 numbers. 				[20]
2. Enter the program on the microprocessor kit. 							[5]
3. Execute the program. Write the contents of data memory locations
before and after execution as well as the contents of the registers
used in the program after execution and also the bit contents of all
five flags individually. Verify the results. 								[5]

Experiment No. 4
1. Write assembly language program to convert memory location of C000 H to an ASCII character memory location C000 H contains a single hexadecimal digit. Store result at location C001 H. 												[20]
2. Enter the program on the microprocessor kit. 							[5]
3. Execute the program. Write the contents of data memory locations
before and after execution as well as the contents of the registers
used in the program after execution and also the bit contents of all
five flags individually. Verify the results. 								[5]

Experiment No. 5
1. Write assembly language program to copy block of 4 consecutive bytes storage from 1000 H to 1003 H. Transfer the entire block to new location from C004 H. 				[20]
2. Enter the program on the microprocessor kit. 							[5]
3. Execute the program. Write the contents of data memory locations
before and after execution as well as the contents of the registers
used in the program after execution and also the bit contents of all
five flags individually. Verify the results. 								[5]
